# Changelog

<br>

### `Latest`
# **Version 1.1.0**
The entire library fetching system has been reworked to be cleaner, and work with Jellyfin. Almost every component has been touched up in some way. Images now get defined qualities significantly improving performance on top of the new system. Reworked caching ensures your data doesn't go stale, but is remembered. Opt-in analytics have been introduced in an effort to get more tester feedback. + **A WHOLE LOT MORE**

#### What's New
- **Jellyfin Support**
- Reworked library fetching, the app now defines adapters for Navidrome and Jellyfin that it can use throughout the app.
- Touched up screens throughout.
- Images now define what quality they should be. No more fetching a big image for a smaller image in the app.
- Tanstack Query is now used by components, directly talking to the api adapter.
- Query lets the app know when to refetch, and can persist data.
- A **New** server screen lets users easily switch between Navidrome and Jellyfin.
- Reworked playback, RNTP isn't reliable so the app handles the queue now, increasing performance and load times.
